Hi!

I program using SDL2 + opengles2 under linux without problems.
Due to course requirements, i need compile and run applications (course jobs) under
windows.
I generated the libGLESv2 and libEGL libraries from the ANGLE project without
problems. (I tested the libraries running Hello_Triangle from ANGLE samples.)
Without doubt i do something wrong during the setup of SDL/OpenGL ES 2.0.

Someone can see the app and tell me what is wrong with the library setup?
The app only clear the window with the red color
Thanks in advance,
Juan!


The instructions for build the app are in COMPILE.txt
Cmake: http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.12.2-win32-x86.exe
Visual Studio version used: Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0
